# Spotify EDA Project

## Project Overview

The repo contains code for a project in my MSc course, which explains what I have done as part of the programme, which explains my ability in intermediate data analysis and visualization using Python.

This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Spotify dataset to uncover insights about musical features, trends, and patterns. The analysis leverages Python and libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## Dataset

The dataset includes various musical attributes of songs sourced from Spotifyâ€™s Web API, such as acousticness, danceability, energy, and tempo.

## Analysis Steps

1. Data Preprocessing: Load and clean the data.
2. Descriptive Statistics: Summarize numerical and categorical features.
3. Data Visualization: Visualize distributions and relationships of features.
4. Correlation Analysis: Examine correlations between musical attributes.
5. Genre Analysis: Explore characteristics of different genres.
6. Trend Analysis: Identify temporal trends in music features.

## Key Results

- Distribution Insights: Visualizations of feature distributions like danceability and energy.
- Correlation Findings: Analysis of relationships between different musical attributes.
- Genre Insights: Comparison of musical features across genres.
- Temporal Trends: Observations on how music features have changed over time.

## Technical Skills

- Data Manipulation: Efficient data handling with pandas.
- Visualization: Creating visual insights using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- Statistical Analysis: Summarizing and interpreting data features.
- Python Programming: Writing clean and efficient Python code.
